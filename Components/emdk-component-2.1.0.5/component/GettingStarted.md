# EMDK For Xamarin 
The EMDK for Xamarin v2.1 provides developers with a comprehensive set of tools to easily create powerful line of business applications for Android enterprise mobile computing devices while retaining their C# skills and tools. The EMDK for Xamarin includes class libraries, sample applications with source code, as well as all of the associated documentation to help your applications take full advantage of what Zebra Technologies devices have to offer.

One unique feature to EMDK for Xamarin is to control device behavior and configuration through the use of profiles. The EMDK Profile Manager lets you create profiles right from your IDE using a GUI interface for selecting the features and settings that your application wishes to use. Then in your application you would simply apply the profile when needed. This results in a simple approach and minimal lines of code required to accomplish tasks resulting in reduced development time, effort and errors.

## 3) Understand Profile Manager
One unique feature to EMDK for Xamarin is to control device behavior and configuration through the use of *profiles*. The EMDK Profile Manager lets you create profiles right from your IDE using a GUI interface for selecting the features and settings that your application wishes to use. Then in your application you would simply apply the profile when needed. This results in a simple approach and minimal lines of code required to accomplish tasks

Licensee must bring any action under this Agreement within one (1) year after the cause of action arises.

Maintenance. Unless provided for in a separate agreement, Symbol shall not be responsible for maintenance or field service of the Products.

High Risk Activities.

Symbol and its suppliers specifically disclaim any express or implied warranty of fitness for High Risk Activities, and if you elect to use the Products in any High Risk Activities, you agree to indemnify, defend, and hold Symbol harmless from and against any and all costs, damages, and losses related to that use.

U.S. Government.  If you are acquiring the Products on behalf of any unit or agency of the U.S. Government, the following shall apply.

Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the United States of America to the extent that they apply and otherwise by the laws of the State of New York without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.

Compliance with Laws.  Licensee will comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including export laws and regulations of the United States.  Licensee will not, without the prior authorization of Symbol and the appropriate governmental authority of the United States, in any form export or re-export, sell or resell, ship or reship, or divert, through direct or indirect means, any item or technical data or direct or indirect products sold or otherwise furnished to any person within any territory for which the United States Government or any of its agencies at the time of the action, requires an export license or other governmental approval.  Violation of this provision will be a material breach of this Agreement, permitting immediate termination by Symbol.

Assignments and Subcontracting.  Symbol may assign any of its rights or subcontract any of its obligations under this Agreement, or encumber or sell any of its rights in any Software, without prior notice to or consent of Licensee.

Third Party Software.  The Products may contain one or more items of Third-Party Software. The terms of this Agreement govern your use of any Third-Party Software UNLESS A SEPARATE THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE LICENSE IS INCLUDED, IN WHICH CASE YOUR USE OF THE THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE WILL THEN BE GOVERNED BY THE SEPARATE THIRD-PARTY LICENSE.

Open Source Software. The Products may contain one or more items of Open Source Software. Open Source Software is software covered by a publicly available license governed solely under Copyright law, whereas the complete terms and obligations of such license attach to a licensee solely through the act of copying, using and/or distribution of the licensed software, such obligations often include one or more of attribution obligations, distribution obligations, copyleft obligations, and intellectual property encumbrances. The use of any Open Source Software is subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as well as the terms and conditions of the corresponding license of each Open Source Software package.  If there is a conflict between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of the Open Source Software license, the applicable Open Source Software license will take precedence. Copies of the licenses for the included Open Source Software, if any, as well as their attributions, acknowledgements, and software information details, are provided in the electronic copy of this Agreement, which is available in the Legal Notices or README file associated with the Product. Symbol is required to reproduce the software licenses, acknowledgments and copyright notices as provided by the authors and owners, thus, all such information is provided in its native language form, without modification or translation. Depending on the license terms of the specific Open Source Software, source code may not be provided. Please reference and review the entire Open Source Software information to identify which Open Source Software packages have source code provided or available.  For instructions on how to obtain a copy of any source code made publicly available by Zebra related to Open Source Software distributed by Zebra, you may send your request (including the Zebra Product name and version, along with the Open Source Software specifics) in writing to: Zebra Technologies Corporation, Open Source Software Director, Legal Department, 3 Overlook Point, Lincolnshire, IL  60069 USA.
